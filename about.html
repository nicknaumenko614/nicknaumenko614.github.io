        <p>
          My life is a yarnball of experiences. Born in Soviet Union, I started
          music school when I was 4, learning how to play violin and piano. 10
          years into it I could play good enough to be considered for a career
          as a classical violinist. But, I hated the violin about as much as I
          loved all things technology, and immigrating to the United States at
          the age of 14 gave me a chance to do what I want, instead of what my
          parents thought I should. During my teenage years, I dove right into
          exploration. I was really into cars, computers and electronics. I
          obtained a (now useless) college degree, worked a dozen jobs and
          started 2 automotive businesses. Fast forward to today, I strive to be
          a software developer with a focus on providing modern software
          solutions to automotive repair facilities. I am enrolled in
          WeCanCodeIT, a full-stack Java bootcamp that will give me the
          knowledge and confidence that I need to enter the world of software
          development and achieve my next set of goals.
